----------------
This program highlights fires in an image by identifying
pixels who red intensity is more than INTENSITY_THRESHOLD times
the average of the red, green, and blue values at a pixel.
Those "sufficiently red" pixels are then highlighted in the
image and the rest of the image is turned grey, by setting the
pixels red, green, and blue values all to be the same average
value.
